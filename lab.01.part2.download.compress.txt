Part 1 - Paths and Review
==========
Follow the instructions line-by-line.

* Type in the commands as is, but ignore the beginning prompt.
* Enter, tab, up and down are represented by <ENTER><TAB>,<UP> and <DOWN>.
* "No output" or "nothing happens" are valid answers to any of the questions.

Feel free to use your workstation to test your answers to the questions that don't explicitly tell you to run a command)
==========

==========
1. Write the command that you would use to change to the root directory.
----------
$  cd \



==========
2. Write the command that you would use to change to your home directory.
----------
$ cd ~



==========
3. What's the absolute path to your Desktop directory?
----------
/c/Users/TheBl/Desktop



==========
4. If you're in your home directory, how would you create a new directory on your desktop
called stuff without changing your directory?  Write your command below.
----------
$ mkdir -p /Desktop/Gabrielslays
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘/Desktop’: Permission denied (I assume this is how you would do it but my settings don't allow for it)




==========
5. If you're in your Desktop directory, how would you change to two directories right above it (again, this should be /Users) using a relative path?  Write your command below.
----------
$ cd ../..



==========
6. What's the shortcut for changing to the directory that you were just previously in?  For example, if I were in /Volumes... and I changed to /Users/professor/Desktop, what's a quick way of changing to /Volumes without writing something like cd /Volumes?
----------
$ cd -


==========
7. How would you show all of the files (including hidden ones) with detailed (long) information
for all files on your Desktop — if you're currently in your home directory?  Write your command below.
----------
$ ls -ait Desktop
$ ls -alt Desktop (This one should be right?)
$ $ ls -l Desktop (No sorry, it's just the L and I'm le stupid)
